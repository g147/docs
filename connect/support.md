# Technical Support

* Numerai's data science community lives primarily at [RocketChat](https://community.numer.ai). If you are having problems with our data, API or website, please contact us on the #[support channel](https://community.numer.ai/channel/support) and we will get back to you ASAP. 
* Look for the `Admin` or `Team` tag to identify the Numerai team. At any given time, one Numerai engineer will be available for technical support. We will try our best to get back to you within 24 hours. We will **NEVER** ask for your password, secret keys or have you send us any money.
* Email us at [support@numer.ai](mailto:support@numer.ai)

For security reasons, **Numerai will never recover an account that is secured with MFA**. This is to prevent others from impersonating and taking over your account. We recognize that this is not the best user experience, but because large amounts of NMR accounts can hold, we must prioritize security above all else.\
\
When setting up MFA on your account, **note down your recovery codes** and save them in a secure location. These recovery codes will allow you to regain access to your account should you lose access to your MFA device. At the time of signing on to the Numerai, simply enter a recovery code when prompted to enter MFA.\
\
Some users choose not to enable MFA at all. This is not recommended as it decreases the security of your account.
