# Introduction

[Numerai](https://numer.ai), founded by Richard Craib in San Francisco in 2015, is the hardest data science tournament on the planet that is organized on a weekly-basis to build world's last global equity hedge fund that trades a meta model based on an aggregation of thousands of predictions made by a global network of crowdsourced data scientists competing & staking an ERC-20 token termed Numeraire(NMR), through Erasure protocol, to profit from their accurate predictions done on a free but obfuscated dataset.

With interviews from [Howard Morgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_L.\_Morgan) (co-founder of Renaissance Technologies), [Norman Packard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Packard) (co-founder of Prediction Company), [Peter Diamandis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Diamandis) (founder of XPRIZE, Singularity University), [Olaf Carlson-Wee](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/olaf-carlson-wee#section-overview) (founder of Polychain Capital, formerly Coinbase), [Joey Krug](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/joey-krug) (founder of Augur, Thiel Fellow, Pantera) and others, in this short film, we explain how Numerai has solved the problem of sharing secret financial data, by intelligently encrypting and distributing it freely & is synthesizing machine intelligence to command the capital of an American hedge fund..
